# Live-Busses-Feed

Native iOS app to view DTC and DIMTS busses near your location.

Each bus is marked with its bus number. There are 4 type of busses. They are categorized by color as follows-

🔴 DTC AC <br>
🟢 DTC NON-AC <br>
🔵 DIMTS AC <br>
🟠 DIMTS NON-AC <br>


## Technologies 📡
* UIKit
* MapKit
* Swift

## How it works 🧐
* When the coordinates for an annotation changes, update them on the map and animate the change.
* If in our latest nearby busses response, there is a bus which was on screen but is not in the response, remove it from the map.
* If a new bus comes which isnt on the map already, add it to the map.
